# Yearn Web Lib

![](../../.github/og.jpeg)

Yearn web Lib is a library of standard components used through Yearn's Projects.
This library is made for React projects with the idea to be light, efficient and easy to use.
We are using React + Tailwindcss + ethersjs for the web3 package, and some contexts are available to correctly wrap your app.
